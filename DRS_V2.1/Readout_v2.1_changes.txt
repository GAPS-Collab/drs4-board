fix shunt resistor
fix footprint ldo
add external circuit to board
enig finish
add caps for sd clk
add terminator resistor sd clk
add bypass to mars 

board thickness.

analog front end:
Determine cause of reflectios:
  - Ground cut out not done on transformer input?
  - SMA input trace width?
  - Via fencing around circuit
  -(remove C210 capacitor ) - 
  note: transformer already ac-couples signal. 
  
  try different function generator....
  
  Cant conclude an impedance issue....
  
  RF Switch. doubly terminated....
  
  Probe the RF IN/OUT.
  
  
  what is causing the attenuation....
  probe the connection with broken rf switch.
  
  
  sma_evaluation to readout_board
  
  try shorting grounds and re-probe
  
  poke ground pad..
  
  
  
  
  short control signals. 
  
  short transformer and switch
  
  
  
  tests done:
  -(Input) RFC : Outputs(RF1 or RF2):
    Results: Still got the same results as before: coupling of RC occurs at ports RF1 and RF2 when switch is cofigured as "all off-state"
	
 -Removed ac coupled capacitor at sma input, as the transformer already ac couples the signal. Still got the same results.....
 
 
 -resolution: 
 buy pe4251 chips, and populate onto solder breadboard to test...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 - probed pe4251 RF Switch on the DRS4 Evaluation board. 
   REsults: THe isolation is clearly there. With a signal present in the SMA connection, the switch can select tca connection without any coupling from the SMA connection.
